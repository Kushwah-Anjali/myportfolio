    Hi,I’m Anjali Kushwah, a passionate BCA 2nd-year student and an aspiring web developer. Though I didn’t start my coding journey until my second semester, I’ve been fully immersed in learning and growing since then. Here's a glimpse of my journey so far:<h3>My coding journey</h3>It all began with HTML and CSS, learning through a phone compiler since I didn’t have access to a laptop initially. In July 2024, I finally got a laptop, and that's when my development journey truly kicked off. Balancing my studies, coding practice,
  and life has been challenging at times, but I manage to push through and dedicate time to self-learning daily. Though there are days I struggle with procrastination, I’ve remained committed to developing my skills through hands-on projects.<h3> Shalini of Udayan Care Foundation</h3>Beyond academics, I’m a proud member of the Udayan Care Foundation, an NGO focused on girl empowerment and education. Here, I’ve been mentored by experienced professionals like lawyers, CA's, and other experts, gaining valuable life insights.
 One life-changing experience was receiving free counseling from Dr. Chinu Agarwal, which otherwise would have been a costly session for others. These experiences continue to motivate me to aim high and help others in any way I can.<h3>Personal Growth</h3>I was once a very shy person, but I realized I needed to step out of my comfort zone. One of the most memorable moments of my personal growth was delivering a speech in front of 400 people. The pride in my parents’ eyes that day reminded me how far I’ve come, and it motivated me to keep striving for more. It was a moment of realization that growth comes when we face our fears and take action.<h3>What’s Next?</h3> I’m excited about the future and eager to continue improving my skills. I know that every line of code brings me closer to my goal of becoming a proficient web developer. I’m committed to pushing through every challenge and seizing opportunities that come my way.
 Happy Coding! </p>
